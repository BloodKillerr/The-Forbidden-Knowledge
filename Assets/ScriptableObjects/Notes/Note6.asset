  title: Too soon
  content: The years went by, and the boy became a man. Still struggling to survive,
    his spirit stronger than ever. The King knew that soon, the day will come when
    he shall reveal himself to the man and offer him guidance in the journey envisioned
    for him. But that day came sooner than expected. Too soon.
