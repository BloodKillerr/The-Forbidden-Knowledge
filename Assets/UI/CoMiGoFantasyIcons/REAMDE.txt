This icon pack was made by CoMiGo. The license is CC0, which is effectively public domain, which means that you can use the assets however you want.

Besides graphical assets, I usually build game making tools â€” a game engine ct.js, for example. Check my stuff at https://comigo.itch.io/

If you want to donate, I unfortunately cannot accept payments at itch.io, but you can donate at Boosty:

Happy coding!
